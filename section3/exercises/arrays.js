//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log (animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.push("Gorilla");
console.log(animals);
// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push('Llama');
animals[0]= 'Zebra'
animals[1]='Giraffe'
animals[2]= 'Llama';
animals[3]= 'Elephant';
animals[4]= 'Gorilla';
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[3]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ['Sushi', 'Tacos', 'Burger', 'Ramen'];
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.

console.log (foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push('Broccoli');
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop('Broccoli');
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push('Pizza');
foods.push('Pasta');
foods.push('Cake');
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Facebook- there a lists of users when they like or comment on a post
// 2: Facebook Messanger- whehn you have a group chat you can see the list of users in the group
// 3: Reddit- in subreddits there is probably a list of users within that


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.


*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

//if percentBatteryLeft is above 15%, no need to evaluate if user has charger or if its a car charger. Condition will execute to "Call an Uber"
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15){
  console.log("Call an Uber");
//if user has a charger and its a car charger, no need to evaluate the battery percentBatteryLeft. Condition will execute to "Call an Uber"
} else if (hasCharger=== true && chargerType === "car"){
  console.log("Call an Uber");
//block of code will execute when the variable hasCharger is true and chargerType is "car", and evaluates if the percentBatteryLeft is below 15.
// Condition will evaluate to "Call an Uber"
} else if (percentBatteryLeft <= 14 && hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car"){
  console.log("Call an Uber");
//block of code evaluates is percentBatteryLeft is less than or equal to 14 and hasCharger is false. Condition will execute as "Ask a friend to borrow phone"
} else if (percentBatteryLeft <= 14 && hasCharger === false){
  console.log("Ask a friend to borrow phone");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
