## Array Method's
1. push() adds one or more elements at the end of an array
2. pop() removes the last items from an array, I like to think of it like a gun shooting off the last element "pop!" (if that makes sense)
3. shift() gets rid of the first item in an array
4. unshift() adds an element at at the very front of an array- at index 0
