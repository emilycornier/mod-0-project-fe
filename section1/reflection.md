## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
* I try to re-watch lessons or google something before I reach out in Slack. And that has helped, although I do think it takes me longer to do homework sometimes. I do know now I should give as much detail as possible like taking snapshots, writing code and being more descriptive in my questions. I think the first question I asked in Slack could've been avoided if I did more digging.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
* Numbers- Basically you can use all numbers including negatives, decimals in a data type but you cant use a comma to if you had a large number
* Strings- You can wrap characters, numbers and letters in quotes and that will create a string. It is important to remember that opening and closing quote need to be the same whether its a single quote or double quote
* Boolean- Can I just say, that's one funky word.. Ok, so a Booleans are values that can either be true/false. A Boolean can help the computer figure out what is valid or invalid.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
* console.log("Hello World!");
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
* You would start with // any text between after the // will be ignored by JavaScript, and you can also start with /* and end with */ if you have multiple lines. The purpose of the code comment is to help make your work clear to your peers or co workers. You need code comments to be clear about your intentions and reasonings.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
* Variables are like placeholders. When you define a variable you are telling your computer to keep track of what has been used. To explain it to a 5  year old...thats tough. Maybe its like a variable are *labeled* boxes you put your toys in?
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
* My first thought is Instagram, I would guess the variables they use are:
- var username- I would guess the data type that this holds is probably a boolean, in case you misspell your username or you don't have an account yet, a boolean will figure out of that username has been typed correctly or if it exists
- var birthday- The data type for this is probably numbers and a boolean
- var country- Probably a boolean and a string.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
* It is joining strings and variables together using the + sign.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
* My first thought is MyFitnessPal- user has to input what they ate and what activity they did and then MyFitnessPal spits out how on track you are.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
* I know it is encouraged to do as much self research as possible and post questions in your cohorts Slack channel, but when is it ok to reach out to instructors?
